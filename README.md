### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŽµ

Welcome to my GitHub profile. 

This space offers a glimpse into some of the projects I've worked on in recent years. You'll also find related work on the [Deezer](https://github.com/deezer) [Kibo Ryoku](https://github.com/kiboryoku) organisation pages.

Most notably, you will find **recommender system** projects related to my recent role as a [Research Scientist and Coordinator for Music Recommendation](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumesalhagalvan/) for the French music streaming service [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/). Several older repositories also provide access to code and data from my [doctoral research](https://guillaumesalhagalvan.com/doc/phdthesis_gsalhagalvan.pdf) on representation learning with **graph autoencoders** (node embedding, link prediction, community detection, etc) applied to music information retrieval and recommendation problems.

I invite you to visit [my website](https://guillaumesalhagalvan.com/) for a complete list of my publications, with direct links to GitHub repositories and related resources for each of them.

I will soon start a new role as Associate Professor in Machine Learning at [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/).

I am always looking for professionals with common interests to learn and share experience, so feel free to reach out!
