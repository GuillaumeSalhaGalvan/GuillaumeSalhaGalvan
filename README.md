### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŽµ

Welcome to my GitHub profile. 

This space and the [Deezer organization page](https://github.com/deezer) offer a glimpse into various projects I've worked on in recent years.

Specifically, you will encounter **music recommendation** projects related to my most recent role as a [Research Scientist and Coordinator](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumesalhagalvan/) for the French music streaming service [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/). Several older repositories also provide access to code and data from my [doctoral research](https://guillaumesalhagalvan.com/doc/phdthesis_gsalhagalvan.pdf) on representation learning with **graph autoencoders** (node embedding, link prediction, community detection, etc) with application to music information retrieval and recommendation problems.

I invite you to visit [my website](https://guillaumesalhagalvan.com/) for a comprehensive list of my scientific articles, direct links to GitHub repositories and other online resources for each of them, or simply to connect and discuss!
